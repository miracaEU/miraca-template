## Useful markdown tricks

Jupyter book allows for some special formatted boxes e.g. notes, alerts reminders etc. GitHub doesnt render them automatically so the display here can be slightly different.

````md
```{note}
Here is a note!
```
````

> [!NOTE]  
> Here is a note!

````md
```{warning}
Careful now
```
````

> [!WARNING]  
> Careful now

````md
```{Important}
Read this for sure.
```
````

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Read this for sure.
